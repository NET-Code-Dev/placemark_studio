   ```

## Usage

### Basic Conversion

1. **Select KML File**
   - Click "Browse Files" to select your KML file
   - Supported file size: Up to 50MB
   - File validation ensures format compatibility

2. **Preview Data**
   - View the first 5 rows of converted data
   - Check field headers and data types
   - Verify coordinate extraction

3. **Handle Duplicates** (if any)
   - Review detected duplicate headers
   - Choose which duplicates to keep or remove
   - Headers will be automatically numbered if kept

4. **Convert and Save**
   - Click "Convert File" to process
   - Choose output location (defaults to input file directory)
   - Receive confirmation with file path

### Advanced Features

#### File Information Panel
View detailed information about your KML file:
- File name and size
- Number of features and layers
- Coordinate system details
- Geometry type distribution
- Available data fields

#### Bounding Box Preview
- Visual representation of data extent
- Coordinate boundaries (North, South, East, West)
- Center point calculation
- Spatial dimensions

#### Export Options
- **Format Selection**: Currently supports CSV (more formats planned)
- **Output Path**: Custom save location
- **Header Options**: Include/exclude headers
- **Field Selection**: Choose specific fields to export

## File Format Support

### Input Formats
- **KML (.kml)**: Keyhole Markup Language files
  - Standard KML geometries (Point, LineString, Polygon)
  - Extended Data elements
  - HTML tables in descriptions
  - Style references

### Output Formats
- **CSV (.csv)**: Comma Separated Values
  - Customizable delimiters
  - Proper escaping of special characters
  - Header row options

### Planned Formats
- GeoJSON (.geojson)
- Shapefile (.shp)
- Excel (.xlsx)
- GPX (.gpx)

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:
